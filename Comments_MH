Comments for Dec. 2 Meeting:

Lines 5-6: "The intervals they were observed were randomized as much as possible:" need a little more detail here. Also, how did you select which horses to observe on a particular day?
If you showed up to take observations, which horses did you decide to observe? This may have been out of your control but should be stated here.

Line 12: What social behaviors could be observed in horses that were alone?

Lines 22 - 27: Was the construction of a turnout score something you developed on your own or was it something present in other resources you looked at?
I imagine that it's somewhat arbitrary adding together things like "minutes" and the "swishing score" because it would be very dependent on how long the 
observation interval was. (if it was an hour, then minutes grazing would have a much stronger effect on the turnout score, whereas if it was 10 minutes,
then minutes grazing would have a much lesser effect on the turnout score).

Lines 30 - 34: I think you had a source (or multiple sources?) for this personality assessment method. If so, those should be cited here. 
If you used other sources in the methods described in earlier paragraphs, it would be good to cite those too!

Nice work, Clara! We'll chat more later today.
