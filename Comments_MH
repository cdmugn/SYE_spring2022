Comments February 15: One thing that we can tackle before we start using shiny (which we will start in Data Viz next week) is adding a short introduction section. The
literature review you pushed is a great start to this: you can use many of these sources in your introduction. You might also look at the references from those sources and see
if any of them would be worthwhile reading.

In addition to general background from those sources, the introduction can also describe your broad motivation and goals for the project. The final paragraph of it should then
give a quick preview of the rest of the write-up. You might save this final paragraph for when the write-up is actually complete (it may be easire to describe what the reader
should expect __after__ you already write the methods, results, and discussion.

Nice work!



Comments for Dec. 2 Meeting:

Lines 5-6: "The intervals they were observed were randomized as much as possible:" need a little more detail here. Also, how did you select which horses to observe on a particular day?
If you showed up to take observations, which horses did you decide to observe? This may have been out of your control but should be stated here.

Line 12: What social behaviors could be observed in horses that were alone?

Lines 22 - 27: Was the construction of a turnout score something you developed on your own or was it something present in other resources you looked at?
I imagine that it's somewhat arbitrary adding together things like "minutes" and the "swishing score" because it would be very dependent on how long the 
observation interval was. (if it was an hour, then minutes grazing would have a much stronger effect on the turnout score, whereas if it was 10 minutes,
then minutes grazing would have a much lesser effect on the turnout score).

Lines 30 - 34: I think you had a source (or multiple sources?) for this personality assessment method. If so, those should be cited here. 
If you used other sources in the methods described in earlier paragraphs, it would be good to cite those too!

Nice work, Clara! We'll chat more later today. 

Comments for Dec. 9 Meeting:

Line 7: which was.... (how did you rotate through the fields: can you describe this in just a sentence?)

Lines 8 - 9: So the schedule is set by someone else? The ones being observed "change each week" but that is entirely at the control of the equestrian supervisor, correct?

Line 16: run-on sentence: "...positive being" should start a new sentence. 

Lines 22 - 25: where did this scale come from? Why -4, -2, 2, and 4 and not -6, -3, 3, and 6 or some other numbers here?

Line 31: We will chat about references and citations at our meeting.

Line 31 - 34: run-on sentence.

Line 42: If the book that the website references at the end is available at the library, it might be better to read the chapter on horse personality types and cite that
