- Exploring multilevel scenarios, it looks like Age and Group may be related, with different slopes for group and non-group, so as age increases in a group the group does better but as age increases in individual horses they do worse. 

- Flymask also seems to have significant differences in slopes and intercepts. 


- The different personalities definitely are different, and we have seen that each horse is different so we do need to account for the grouped horses. 

- the personalities seem to make a difference in the slopes here but we have to be mindful of the fact that there are very few of each personality. 


Unconditional means model:
```{r}
unmeanmod = lmer(Overall ~ 1 + (1|Horse), data = turnout_data, REML = T)
summary(unmeanmod)
```
- looking at the unconditional means model, the ICC value is (147.1/(103.2+147.1) = 0.59, so this is a multilevel data set and needs to be allowed to have different intercepts and slopes for different horses.
